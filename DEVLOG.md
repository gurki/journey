- printed touchmapper sample, it's awesome
- idea: put it in front of a led matrix and draw route on there!
- could even put a screen next to it to display high-res content
- reverse engineering arc json format
- use hashes and set diffs to identify and group timeline item entries
- identify 50m gps accuracy as reasonable cutoff [arc/results/accuracy.txt]()

- blender gmaps 3d tiles with blosm
- pretty rough, and hard to make printable
- osm tiles cleaner, but still non-trivial to make printable
- discovered [touch-mapper.org]()
- through that discovered osm overpass api
- did some first designs and basic test
- looked into arc mini data and exported recent samples
- excited for the next day
